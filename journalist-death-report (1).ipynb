    "Exploratory data analysis on journalists-killed-worldwide-since 1992 dataset resulted in several points to be noticed related to journalists deaths,\n",
    "* Throughout the world, Iraq has witnessed most number of journalists deaths but the trend there started since 2003.\n",
    "* Most common death practice on journalists has always been murder but with time it has shifted towards crossfire/combat related death practices.\n",
    "* Male journalists are more likely to be killed may be foreign or local but most of the deaths reported are local.\n",
    "* There has always been motive behind journalists killing and those killed worked for Freelancer organization mainly. This shows that journalists working for Freelancer organization have less security. \n",
    "* Coverage area for journalists have been war and politics mostly, leading to killing of journalists working there.\n",
    "* Journalists generally work for television and print media, covering war and politics respectively and therefore, these fields have witnessed more deaths than any other medium of publishing. \n",
    "* For their work, they have been given impunity for murder followed by threatning and captivating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Journalists have been working very hard to provide us the right news and the coverage, so it's there right to be protected from unwanted killing and deaths."
