Journalism is an industry which works day and night to gather information, assess it and provide correct information to the public in the form of news and writings.<br>
But journalists working here even have to sacrifice their lives for collecting right information. <br>
<br>
So,CPJ began compiling detailed records on journalist deaths in 1992. CPJ has applied strict journalistic standards when investigating a death. <br>
One important aspect of their research is determining whether a death was work-related. As a result, they classify deaths as "motive confirmed" or "motive unconfirmed".<br>
<br>
Exploratory data analysis is the best way to find out the relation between death and the work of journalists. <br>
